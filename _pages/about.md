Hello, my name is Seojin Hwang and I am currently an undergraduate student at the Gwangju Institute of Science and Technology. I am majoring in Electrical Engineering and Computer Science, with a minor in AI Convergence. My primary research interests lie in healthcare AI and human-computer interaction (HCI).
